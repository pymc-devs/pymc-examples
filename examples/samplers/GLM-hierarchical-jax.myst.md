# Using JAX for faster sampling

(c) Thomas Wiecki, 2020

*Note: These samplers are still experimental.*

Using the new Theano JAX linker that Brandon Willard has developed, we can compile PyMC3 models to JAX without any change to the PyMC3 code base or any user-level code changes. The way this works is that we take our Theano graph built by PyMC3 and then translate it to JAX primitives. 

Using our Python samplers, this is still a bit slower than the C-code generated by default Theano.

However, things get really interesting when we also express our samplers in JAX. Here we have used the JAX samplers by NumPyro or TFP. This combining of the samplers was done by [Junpeng Lao](https://twitter.com/junpenglao). 

The reason this is so much faster is that while before in PyMC3, only the logp evaluation was compiled while the samplers where still coded in Python, so for every loop we went back from C to Python. With this approach, the model *and* the sampler are JIT-compiled by JAX and there is no more Python overhead during the whole sampling run. This way we also get sampling on GPUs or TPUs for free.

This NB requires the master of [Theano-PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/Theano-PyMC), the [pymc3jax branch of PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/tree/pymc3jax), as well as JAX, TFP-nightly and numpyro.

This is all still highly experimental but extremely promising and just plain amazing.

As an example we'll use the classic Radon hierarchical model. Note that this model is still very small, I would expect much more massive speed-ups with larger models.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import warnings

import arviz as az
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pymc3 as pm
import pymc3.sampling_jax
import theano

print(f"Running on PyMC3 v{pm.__version__}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
az.style.use("arviz-darkgrid")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
data = pd.read_csv(pm.get_data("radon.csv"))
data["log_radon"] = data["log_radon"].astype(theano.config.floatX)
county_names = data.county.unique()
county_idx = data.county_code.values.astype("int32")

n_counties = len(data.county.unique())
```

Unchanged PyMC3 model specification:

```{code-cell} ipython3
with pm.Model() as hierarchical_model:
    # Hyperpriors for group nodes
    mu_a = pm.Normal("mu_a", mu=0.0, sigma=100.0)
    sigma_a = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_a", 5.0)
    mu_b = pm.Normal("mu_b", mu=0.0, sigma=100.0)
    sigma_b = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_b", 5.0)

    # Intercept for each county, distributed around group mean mu_a
    # Above we just set mu and sd to a fixed value while here we
    # plug in a common group distribution for all a and b (which are
    # vectors of length n_counties).
    a = pm.Normal("a", mu=mu_a, sigma=sigma_a, shape=n_counties)
    # Intercept for each county, distributed around group mean mu_a
    b = pm.Normal("b", mu=mu_b, sigma=sigma_b, shape=n_counties)

    # Model error
    eps = pm.HalfCauchy("eps", 5.0)

    radon_est = a[county_idx] + b[county_idx] * data.floor.values

    # Data likelihood
    radon_like = pm.Normal("radon_like", mu=radon_est, sigma=eps, observed=data.log_radon)
```

## Sampling using our old Python NUTS sampler

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
with hierarchical_model:
    hierarchical_trace = pm.sample(
        2000, tune=2000, target_accept=0.9, compute_convergence_checks=False
    )
```

## Sampling using JAX TFP NUTS sampler

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
# Inference button (TM)!
with hierarchical_model:
    hierarchical_trace_jax = pm.sampling_jax.sample_numpyro_nuts(2000, tune=2000, target_accept=0.9)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"Speed-up = {180 / 24}x")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
az.plot_trace(
    hierarchical_trace_jax,
    var_names=["mu_a", "mu_b", "sigma_a_log__", "sigma_b_log__", "eps_log__"],
);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
az.plot_trace(hierarchical_trace_jax, var_names=["a"], coords={"a_dim_0": range(5)});
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%load_ext watermark
%watermark -n -u -v -iv -w
```
