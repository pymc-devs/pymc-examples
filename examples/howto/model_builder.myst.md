## Motivation

+++

Many users face difficulty in deploying their PyMC models to production because deploying/saving/loading a user-created model is not well standardized. One of the reasons behind this is there is no direct way to save or load a model in PyMC like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The new `ModelBuilder` class is aimed to improve this workflow by providing a scikit-learn inspired API to wrap your PyMC models.

The new `ModelBuilder` class allows users to use methods to `fit()`, `predict()`, `save()`, `load()`. Users can create any model they want, inherit the `ModelBuilder` class, and use predefined methods.

+++

Let's go through the full workflow, starting with a simple linear regression PyMC model as it's usually written. Of course, this model is just a place-holder for your own model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Union

import arviz as az
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pymc as pm
import xarray as xr

from numpy.random import RandomState

%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
RANDOM_SEED = 8927

rng = np.random.default_rng(RANDOM_SEED)
az.style.use("arviz-darkgrid")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Generate data
x = np.linspace(start=0, stop=1, num=100)
y = 0.3 * x + 0.5 + rng.normal(0, 1, len(x))
```

## Standard syntax
Usually a PyMC model will have this form:

```{code-cell} ipython3
with pm.Model() as model:
    # priors
    a = pm.Normal("a", mu=0, sigma=1)
    b = pm.Normal("b", mu=0, sigma=1)
    eps = pm.HalfNormal("eps", 1.0)

    # observed data
    y_model = pm.Normal("y_model", mu=a + b * x, sigma=eps, observed=y)

    # Fitting
    idata = pm.sample()
    idata.extend(pm.sample_prior_predictive())

    # posterior predict
    idata.extend(pm.sample_posterior_predictive(idata))
```

How would we deploy this model? Save the fitted model, load it on an instance, and predict? Not so simple.

`ModelBuilder` is built for this purpose. It is currently part of the  `pymc-experimental` package which we can pip install with `pip install pymc-experimental`. As the name implies, this feature is still experimental and subject to change.

+++

## Model builder class

+++

Let's import the `ModelBuilder` class.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pymc_experimental.model_builder import ModelBuilder
```

To define our desired model we inherit from the `ModelBuilder` class. There are a couple of methods we need to define.

```{code-cell} ipython3
class LinearModel(ModelBuilder):
    # Give the model a name
    _model_type = "LinearModel"

    # And a version
    version = "0.1"

    def build_model(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series, **kwargs):
        """
        build_model creates the PyMC model

        Parameters:
        model_config: dictionary
            it is a dictionary with all the parameters that we need in our model example:  a_loc, a_scale, b_loc
        X : pd.DataFrame
            The input data that is going to be used in the model. This should be a DataFrame
            containing the features (predictors) for the model. For efficiency reasons, it should
            only contain the necessary data columns, not the entire available dataset, as this
            will be encoded into the data used to recreate the model.

        y : pd.Series
            The target data for the model. This should be a Series representing the output
            or dependent variable for the model.

        kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments that may be used for model configuration.
        """
        # Check the type of X and y and adjust access accordingly
        X_values = X["input"].values
        y_values = y.values if isinstance(y, pd.Series) else y
        self._generate_and_preprocess_model_data(X_values, y_values)

        with pm.Model(coords=self.model_coords) as self.model:
            # Create mutable data containers
            x_data = pm.MutableData("x_data", X_values)
            y_data = pm.MutableData("y_data", y_values)

            # prior parameters
            a_mu_prior = self.model_config.get("a_mu_prior", 0.0)
            a_sigma_prior = self.model_config.get("a_sigma_prior", 1.0)

            eps_prior = self.model_config.get("eps_prior", 1.0)

            # priors
            a = pm.Normal("a", mu=a_mu_prior, sigma=a_sigma_prior)
            b = pm.Normal("b", mu=b_mu_prior, sigma=b_sigma_prior)
            eps = pm.HalfNormal("eps", eps_prior)

            obs = pm.Normal("y", mu=a + b * x_data, sigma=eps, shape=x_data.shape, observed=y_data)

    def _data_setter(
        self, X: Union[pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray], y: Union[pd.Series, np.ndarray] = None
    ):

        else:

            x_values = X[:, 0]

        with self.model:
            pm.set_data({"x_data": x_values})
            if y is not None:
                pm.set_data({"y_data": y.values if isinstance(y, pd.Series) else y})

    @staticmethod

            self.customer_ids = customer_ids.values #this line is done outside of the function, preferably at the initialization of the model object.
            idata.attrs["customer_ids"] = json.dumps(self.customer_ids.tolist())  # Convert numpy array to a JSON-serializable list.
        """
        pass

        pass

    def _generate_and_preprocess_model_data(
        self, X: Union[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series], y: Union[pd.Series, np.ndarray]
    ) -> None:
        """
        Depending on the model, we might need to preprocess the data before fitting the model.
        all required preprocessing and conditional assignments should be defined here.
        """
        self.model_coords = None  # in our case we're not using coords, but if we were, we would define them here, or later on in the function, if extracting them from the data.
        # as we don't do any data preprocessing, we just assign the data given by the user. Note that it's a very basic model,
        # and usually we would need to do some preprocessing, or generate the coords from the data.
        self.X = X
        self.y = y
```

Now we can create the `LinearModel` object. First step we need to take care of, is data generation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
X = pd.DataFrame(data=np.linspace(start=0, stop=1, num=100), columns=["input"])
y = 0.3 * x + 0.5
y = y + np.random.normal(0, 1, len(x))

model = LinearModel()
```

After making the object of class `LinearModel` we can fit the model using the `.fit()` method.

+++

## Fitting to data

+++

The `fit()` method takes one argument `data` on which we need to fit the model. The meta-data is saved in the `InferenceData` object where also the trace is stored. These are the fields that are stored:

* `id` : This is a unique id given to a model based on model_config, sample_conifg, version, and model_type. Users can use it to check if the model matches to another model they have defined.
* `model_type` : Model type tells us what kind of model it is. This in this case it outputs **Linear Model** 
* `version` : In case you want to improve on models, you can keep track of model by their version. As the version changes the unique hash in the `id` also changes.
* `sample_conifg` : It stores values of the sampler configuration set by user for this particular model.
* `model_config` : It stores values of the model configuration set by user for this particular model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
idata = model.fit(X, y)
```

## Saving model to file

+++

After fitting the model, we can probably save it to share the model as a file so one can use it again.
To `save()` or `load()`, we can quickly call methods for respective tasks with the following syntax.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fname = "linear_model_v1.nc"
model.save(fname)
```

This saves a file at the given path, and the name <br>
A NetCDF `.nc` file that stores the inference data of the model.

+++

## Loading a model

+++

Now if we wanted to deploy this model, or just have other people use it to predict data, they need two things:
1. the `LinearModel` class (probably in a .py file)
2. the linear_model_v1.nc file

With these, you can easily load a fitted model in a different environment (e.g. production):

```{code-cell} ipython3
model_2 = LinearModel.load(fname)
```

Note that `load()` is a class-method, we do not need to instantiate the `LinearModel` object.

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(model_2)
```

## Prediction

+++

Next we might want to predict on new data. The `predict()` method allows users to do posterior prediction with the fitted model on new data.

Our first task is to create data on which we need to predict.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_pred = np.random.uniform(low=1, high=2, size=10)
prediction_data = pd.DataFrame({"input": x_pred})
type(prediction_data["input"].values)
```

`ModelBuilder` provides two methods for prediction:
1. point estimates (the mean) with `predict()`
2. full posterior prediction (samples) with `predict_posterior()`

```{code-cell} ipython3
pred_mean = model_2.predict(prediction_data)
# samples
pred_samples = model_2.predict_posterior(prediction_data)
```

After using the `predict()`, we can plot our data and see graphically how satisfactory our `LinearModel` is.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 7))
posterior = az.extract(idata, num_samples=20)
x_plot = xr.DataArray(np.linspace(1, 2, 100))
y_plot = posterior["b"] * x_plot + posterior["a"]
Line2 = ax.plot(x_plot, y_plot.transpose(), color="C1")
Line1 = ax.plot(x_pred, pred_mean, "x")
ax.set(title="Posterior predictive regression lines", xlabel="x", ylabel="y")
ax.legend(
    handles=[Line1[0], Line2[0]], labels=["predicted average", "inferred regression line"], loc=0
);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%load_ext watermark
%watermark -n -u -v -iv -w -p pymc_experimental
```
