Here is an citation template in bibtex:

```bibtex
@incollection{citekey,
  author    = "<notebook authors, see above>"
  title     = "<notebook title>",
  editor    = "PyMC Team",
  booktitle = "PyMC examples",
  doi       = "10.5281/zenodo.5654871"
}
```

which once rendered could look like:

<!-- continues in _templates/page.html!!! -->
<!-- I wanted to get some kind of automatation to the process,
and html templates have access to many variables that are not available
from jinja-myst -->
