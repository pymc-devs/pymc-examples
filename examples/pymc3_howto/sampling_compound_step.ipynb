    "A recurrent issue/concern is the validity of mixing discrete and continuous sampling, especially mixing other samplers with NUTS. While in the book [Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/) Chapter 12.4, there is a small paragraph on \"Combining Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Gibbs sampling\", which suggests that this could be a valid way to do, the Stan developers are always skeptical about how practical it is. (Here are more discussions about this issue [1](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/mcmc-sampling-does-not-work-when-execute/1918/47), [2](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/constraining-latent-factor-model-baysian-probabalisic-matrix-factorization-to-remove-multimodality/2152/21)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The concern with mixing discrete and continuous sampling is that the change in discrete parameters will affect the continuous distribution's geometry so that the adaptation (i.e., the tuned mass matrix and step size) may be inappropriate for the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. HMC/NUTS is hypersensitive to its tuning parameters (mass matrix and step size). Another issue is that we also don't know how many iterations we have to run to get a decent sample when the discrete parameters change. Though it hasn't been fully evaluated, it seems that if the discrete parameter is in low dimensions (e.g., 2-class mixture models, outlier detection with explicit discrete labeling), the mixing of discrete sampling with HMC/NUTS works OK. However, it is much less efficient than marginalizing out the discrete parameters. And sometimes it can be observed that the Markov chains get stuck quite often. In order to evaluate this more properly, one can use a simulation-based method to look at the posterior coverage and establish the computational correctness, as explained in [Cook, Gelman, and Rubin 2006](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/106186006x136976)."
