    "# PyMC 4.0 Release Announcement\n",
    "\n",
    "We, the PyMC core development team, are incredibly excited to announce the release of a major rewrite of PyMC3 (now called just PyMC): `4.0`. This marks the first major new version in over 10 years. There are many exciting new updates that we will talk about in this and upcoming blog posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Full API compatibility for model building\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the main question out of the way: Yes, you can just keep your existing PyMC modeling code without having to change anything (in most cases) and get all the improvements for free. The only thing most users will have to change is the import from `import pymc3 as pm` to `import pymc as pm`. For more information, see the [quick migration guide](https://www.pymc-labs.io/blog-posts/the-quickest-migration-guide-ever-from-pymc3-to-pymc-v40/). If you are using more advanced features of PyMC beyond the modeling API, you might have to change some things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## It's now called PyMC instead of PyMC3\n",
    "First, the biggest news: **PyMC3 has been renamed to PyMC. PyMC3 version 3.x will stay under the current name to not break production systems but future versions will use the PyMC name everywhere.** While there were a few reasons for this, the main one is that PyMC3 4.0 is quite confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What about PyMC4?\n",
    "If you don't know what PyMC4 is, you can just skip this section. In brief, it was an experiment we did using TensorFlow Probability as a backend which we gave up on. The motivation for abandoning this is described in our previous post [\"The Future of PyMC3, or: Theano is Dead, Long Live Theano\"](https://pymc-devs.medium.com/the-future-of-pymc3-or-theano-is-dead-long-live-theano-d8005f8a0e9b)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you should refer to the new version as \"PyMC 4.0\" or \"PyMC v4\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theano -> Aesara\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting to know other tensor libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch better made us realize how amazing and unique `Theano` really is. It has a mature and hackable code base and a simple graph representation that allows easy graph manipulations, something that's very useful for probabilistic programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we went ahead and forked the library and undertook a massive cleaning up of the code-base (this charge was led by [Brandon Willard](https://twitter.com/brandontwillard)), removing swaths of old and obscure code, and restructuring the entire library to be more developer friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rewrite motivated renaming the package to [`Aesara`](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara) (Theano's daughter in Greek mythology). Quickly, a new developer team focused around improving `aesara` independent of `PyMC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major new feature are the two new computational backends: `JAX` and `numba`. The way this works is that `aesara` is best understood as a computational graph library that allows you to build a computational graphs out of array-operations (additions, multiplications, dot-products, indexing, for-loops). From this graph representation, we can do various things:\n",
    "* graph optimizations like `log(exp(x)) -> x`\n",
    "* symbolic rewrites like `N(0, 1) + a` -> `N(a, 1)`\n",
    "* compilation of that graph to various computational backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, `theano` supported Python and C as computational backends. But with `aesara` it is now possible, and in fact quite easy, to add new computational backends. We have currently added a `JAX` backend that comes with GPU support (see [this blog post](https://martiningram.github.io/mcmc-comparison/) for some impressive speed-ups using GPUs for sampling). We're also in the process of adding a `numba` backend.\n",

    "### New JAX backend for faster sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most exciting new feature are the new computational backends and the associated speed-ups. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, `aesara` provides a representation of the model logp graph in form of various `aesara` `Ops` (operators) which represent the computations to be be performed. For example `exp(x + y)` would be an `Add` `Op` with two input arguments `x` and `y`. The result of the `Add` `Op` is then inputted into an `exp` `Op`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This computation graph doesn't say anything about how we actually *execute* this graph. Before, we would transpile this graph to C-code which would then get compiled, loaded into Python as a C-extension, and then executed. But now, we can just transpile this graph to `JAX` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this by itself is already pretty exciting, because `JAX` is capable of a whole bunch of low-level optimizations which lead to faster logp evaluations, we still have our samplers written in Python, so there is still some call-overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get rid of this, we can link the `JAX` graph produced by `aesara` with a sampler also written in `JAX`. That way, the model logp evaluation *and* the sampler are one big JAX graph that gets optimized and executed without any Python call-overhead. We currently support a NUTS implementation provided by `numpyro` as well as `blackjax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early experiments and benchmarks show impressive speed-ups. Here is a small example of how much faster this is on a fairly small and simple model: the hierarchical linear regression of the famous Radon example."

That way, our model logp, consisting out of `aesara` `Ops` can be combined with the sampler logic, also consisting out of `aesara` `Ops`, into one big `aesara` graph.\n",
