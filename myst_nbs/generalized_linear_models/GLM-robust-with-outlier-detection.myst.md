# GLM: Robust Regression using Custom Likelihood for Outlier Classification

:::{post} 17 Nov, 2021
:tags: regression, robust analysis 
:category: intermediate
:author: Jon Sedar, Thomas Wiecki, Raul Maldonado, Oriol Abril
:::

Using PyMC3 for Robust Regression with Outlier Detection using the Hogg 2010 Signal vs Noise method. 

**Modelling concept:**
+ This model uses a custom likelihood function as a mixture of two likelihoods, one for the main data-generating function (a linear model that we care about), and one for outliers.
+ The model does not marginalize and thus gives us a classification of outlier-hood for each datapoint
+ The dataset is tiny and hardcoded into this Notebook. It contains errors in both the x and y, but we will deal here with only errors in y.

**Complementary approaches:**
+ This is a complementary approach to the Student-T robust regression as illustrated in the example {doc}`generalized_linear_models/GLM-robust`, and that approach is also compared
+ See also a [gist by Dan FM](https://gist.github.com/dfm/5250dd2f17daf60cbe582ceeeb2fd12f) that he published after a quick twitter conversation - his "Hogg improved" model uses this same model structure and cleverly marginalizes over the outlier class but also observes it during sampling using a `pm.Deterministic` <- this is really nice
+ The likelihood evaluation is essentially a copy of eqn 17 in "Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data" - {cite:t}`hogg2010data`
+ The model is adapted specifically from Jake Vanderplas' and Brigitta Sipocz' [implementation](http://www.astroml.org/book_figures/chapter8/fig_outlier_rejection.html) in the AstroML book {cite:p}`iveziÄ‡2014astroMLtext,vanderplas2012astroML`

### Load Data

+++

We'll use the Hogg 2010 data available at  https://github.com/astroML/astroML/blob/master/astroML/datasets/hogg2010test.py

It's a very small dataset so for convenience, it's hardcoded below

```{code-cell} ipython3
# cut & pasted directly from the fetch_hogg2010test() function
# identical to the original dataset as hardcoded in the Hogg 2010 paper

dfhogg = pd.DataFrame(
    np.array(
        [
            [1, 201, 592, 61, 9, -0.84],
            [2, 244, 401, 25, 4, 0.31],
            [3, 47, 583, 38, 11, 0.64],
            [4, 287, 402, 15, 7, -0.27],
            [5, 203, 495, 21, 5, -0.33],

            [7, 210, 479, 27, 4, -0.02],
            [8, 202, 504, 14, 4, -0.05],
            [9, 198, 510, 30, 11, -0.84],

            [12, 201, 442, 25, 5, -0.46],
            [13, 157, 317, 52, 5, -0.03],
            [14, 131, 311, 16, 6, 0.50],

## 1. Basic EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis

+++

Note:
+ this is very rudimentary so we can quickly get to the `pymc3` part
+ the dataset contains errors in both the x and y, but we will deal here with only errors in y.
+ see the {cite:t}`hogg2010data` for more detail

```{code-cell} ipython3
with plt.rc_context({"figure.constrained_layout.use": False}):
    gd = sns.jointplot(
        x="x",
        y="y",
        data=dfhogg,
        kind="scatter",
        height=6,
        marginal_kws={"bins": 12, "kde": True, "kde_kws": {"cut": 1}},
        joint_kws={"edgecolor": "w", "linewidth": 1.2, "s": 80},
    )

_ = gd.ax_joint.errorbar(
    "x", "y", "sigma_y", "sigma_x", fmt="none", ecolor="#4878d0", data=dfhogg, zorder=10
)

for idx, r in dfhogg.iterrows():
    _ = gd.ax_joint.annotate(
        text=idx,
        xy=(r["x"], r["y"]),
        xycoords="data",
        xytext=(10, 10),
        textcoords="offset points",
        color="#999999",
        zorder=1,
    )


_ = gd.fig.suptitle(
    (
        "Original datapoints in Hogg 2010 dataset\n"
        + "showing marginal distributions and errors sigma_x, sigma_y"
    ),
    y=1.05,
);
```

**Observe**:  

+ Even judging just by eye, you can see these observations mostly fall on / around a straight line with positive gradient
+ It looks like a few of the datapoints may be outliers from such a line
+ Measurement error (independently on x and y) varies across the observations

+++

## 2. Basic Feature Engineering

+++

### 2.1 Transform and standardize dataset

+++

It's common practice to standardize the input values to a linear model, because this leads to coefficients 
sitting in the same range and being more directly comparable. e.g. this is noted in {cite:t}`gelman2008scaling`

So, following Gelman's paper above, we'll divide by 2 s.d. here

+ since this model is very simple, we just standardize directly, 
rather than using e.g. a `scikit-learn` `FunctionTransformer`
+ ignoring `rho_xy` for now

**Additional note** on scaling the output feature `y` and measurement error `sigma_y`:
+ This is unconventional - typically you wouldn't scale an output feature
+ However, in the Hogg model we fit a custom two-part likelihood function of Normals which encourages 
a globally minimised log-loss by allowing outliers to fit to their own Normal distribution. This 
outlier distribution is specified using a stdev stated as an offset `sigma_y_out` from `sigma_y`
+ This offset value has the effect of requiring `sigma_y` to be restated in the same scale as the stdev of `y`

+++

Standardize (mean center and divide by 2 sd):

```{code-cell} ipython3
dfhoggs = (dfhogg[["x", "y"]] - dfhogg[["x", "y"]].mean(0)) / (2 * dfhogg[["x", "y"]].std(0))
dfhoggs["sigma_x"] = dfhogg["sigma_x"] / (2 * dfhogg["x"].std())
dfhoggs["sigma_y"] = dfhogg["sigma_y"] / (2 * dfhogg["y"].std())
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
with plt.rc_context({"figure.constrained_layout.use": False}):
    gd = sns.jointplot(
        x="x",
        y="y",
        data=dfhoggs,
        kind="scatter",
        height=6,
        marginal_kws={"bins": 12, "kde": True, "kde_kws": {"cut": 1}},
        joint_kws={"edgecolor": "w", "linewidth": 1, "s": 80},
    )
gd.ax_joint.errorbar("x", "y", "sigma_y", "sigma_x", fmt="none", ecolor="#4878d0", data=dfhoggs)
gd.fig.suptitle(
    (
        "Quick view to confirm action of\n"
        + "standardizing datapoints in Hogg 2010 dataset\n"
        + "showing marginal distributions and errors sigma_x, sigma_y"
    ),
    y=1.08,
);
```

## 3. Simple Linear Model with no Outlier Correction

+++

### 3.1 Specify Model

+++

Before we get more advanced, I want to demo the fit of a simple linear model with Normal likelihood function. The priors are also Normally distributed, so this behaves like an OLS with Ridge Regression (L2 norm).

Note: the dataset also has `sigma_x` and `rho_xy` available, but for this exercise, We've chosen to only use `sigma_y`

$$\hat{y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta^{T} \vec{x}_{i}, \sigma_{i})$$

where:  

+ $\beta$ = $\{1, \beta_{j \in X_{j}}\}$  <--- linear coefs in $X_{j}$, in this case `1 + x`
+ $\sigma$ = error term <--- in this case we set this to an _unpooled_ $\sigma_{i}$: the measured error `sigma_y` for each datapoint

```{code-cell} ipython3
coords = {"coefs": ["intercept", "slope"], "datapoint_id": dfhoggs.index}
with pm.Model(coords=coords) as mdl_ols:

    ## Define weakly informative Normal priors to give Ridge regression
    beta = pm.Normal("beta", mu=0, sigma=10, dims="coefs")

    ## Define linear model
    y_est = beta[0] + beta[1] * dfhoggs["x"]

    ## Define Normal likelihood
    pm.Normal("y", mu=y_est, sigma=dfhoggs["sigma_y"], observed=dfhoggs["y"], dims="datapoint_id")

pm.model_to_graphviz(mdl_ols)
```

### 3.2 Fit Model

+++

Note we are purposefully missing a step here for prior predictive checks.

+++

#### 3.2.1 Sample Posterior

```{code-cell} ipython3
with mdl_ols:
    trc_ols = pm.sample(
        tune=5000,
        draws=500,
        chains=4,
        cores=4,
        init="advi+adapt_diag",
        n_init=50000,
        progressbar=True,
        return_inferencedata=True,
    )
```

#### 3.2.2 View Diagnostics

+++

NOTE: We will illustrate this OLS fit and compare to the datapoints in the final comparison plot

+++

Traceplot

```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = az.plot_trace(trc_ols, compact=False)
```

Plot posterior joint distribution (since the model has only 2 coeffs, we can easily view this as a 2D joint distribution)

```{code-cell} ipython3
marginal_kwargs = {"kind": "kde", "rug": True, "color": "C0"}
ax = az.plot_pair(
    trc_ols,
    var_names="beta",
    marginals=True,
    kind=["scatter", "kde"],
    scatter_kwargs={"color": "C0", "alpha": 0.4},
    marginal_kwargs=marginal_kwargs,
)
fig = ax[0, 0].get_figure()
fig.suptitle("Posterior joint distribution (mdl_ols)", y=1.02);
```

## 4. Simple Linear Model with Robust Student-T Likelihood

+++

I've added this brief section in order to directly compare the Student-T based method exampled in Thomas Wiecki's notebook in the [PyMC3 documentation](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/GLM-robust/)

Instead of using a Normal distribution for the likelihood, we use a Student-T which has fatter tails. In theory this allows outliers to have a smaller influence in the likelihood estimation. This method does not produce inlier / outlier flags (it marginalizes over such a classification) but it's simpler and faster to run than the Signal Vs Noise model below, so a comparison seems worthwhile.

+++

### 4.1 Specify Model

+++

In this modification, we allow the likelihood to be more robust to outliers (have fatter tails)

$$\hat{y} \sim \text{StudentT}(\beta^{T} \vec{x}_{i}, \sigma_{i}, \nu)$$

where:  

+ $\beta$ = $\{1, \beta_{j \in X_{j}}\}$  <--- linear coefs in $X_{j}$, in this case `1 + x`
+ $\sigma$ = error term <--- in this case we set this to an _unpooled_ $\sigma_{i}$: the measured error `sigma_y` for each datapoint
+ $\nu$ = degrees of freedom <--- allowing a pdf with fat tails and thus less influence from outlier datapoints

Note: the dataset also has `sigma_x` and `rho_xy` available, but for this exercise, I've chosen to only use `sigma_y`

```{code-cell} ipython3
with pm.Model(coords=coords) as mdl_studentt:

    # define weakly informative Normal priors to give Ridge regression
    beta = pm.Normal("beta", mu=0, sigma=10, dims="coefs")

    # define linear model
    y_est = beta[0] + beta[1] * dfhoggs["x"]

    # define prior for StudentT degrees of freedom
    # InverseGamma has nice properties:
    # it's continuous and has support x âˆˆ (0, inf)
    nu = pm.InverseGamma("nu", alpha=1, beta=1)

    # define Student T likelihood
    pm.StudentT(
        "y", mu=y_est, sigma=dfhoggs["sigma_y"], nu=nu, observed=dfhoggs["y"], dims="datapoint_id"
    )

pm.model_to_graphviz(mdl_studentt)
```

)
ax[0, 0].get_figure().suptitle("Posterior joint distribution (mdl_studentt)");
```

#### 4.2.3 View the shift in posterior joint distributions from OLS to StudentT

```{code-cell} ipython3
marginal_kwargs["rug"] = False
marginal_kwargs["color"] = "C0"
ax = az.plot_pair(
    trc_ols,
    var_names="beta",
    kind=["scatter", "kde"],
    divergences=True,
    figsize=[12, 12],
    marginals=True,
    marginal_kwargs=marginal_kwargs,
    scatter_kwargs={"color": "C0", "alpha": 0.4},
    kde_kwargs={"contour_kwargs": {"colors": "C0"}},
)

marginal_kwargs["color"] = "C1"
az.plot_pair(
    trc_studentt,
    var_names="beta",
    kind=["scatter", "kde"],
    divergences=True,
    marginals=True,
    marginal_kwargs=marginal_kwargs,
    scatter_kwargs={"color": "C1", "alpha": 0.4},
    kde_kwargs={"contour_kwargs": {"colors": "C1"}},
    ax=ax,
)

ax[0, 0].get_figure().suptitle(
    "Posterior joint distributions\n(showing general movement from OLS to StudentT)"
);
```

**Observe:**

+ Both `beta` parameters appear to have greater variance than in the OLS regression
+ This is due to $\nu$ appearing to converge to a value `nu ~ 1`, indicating 
  that a fat-tailed likelihood has a better fit than a thin-tailed one
+ The parameter `beta[intercept]` has moved much closer to $0$, which is 
  interesting: if the theoretical relationship `y ~ f(x)` has no offset, 
  then for this mean-centered dataset, the intercept should indeed be $0$: it 
  might easily be getting pushed off-course by outliers in the OLS model.
+ The parameter `beta[slope]` has accordingly become greater: perhaps moving 
  closer to the theoretical function `f(x)`

## 5. Linear Model with Custom Likelihood to Distinguish Outliers: Hogg Method

+++

Please read the paper (Hogg 2010) and Jake Vanderplas' code for more complete information about the modelling technique.

The general idea is to create a 'mixture' model whereby datapoints can be described by either:

1. the proposed (linear) model (thus a datapoint is an inlier), or
2. a second model, which for convenience we also propose to be linear, but allow it to have a different mean and variance (thus a datapoint is an outlier)

+++

### 5.1 Specify Model

+++

The likelihood is evaluated over a mixture of two likelihoods, one for 'inliers', one for 'outliers'. A Bernoulli distribution is used to randomly assign datapoints in N to either the inlier or outlier groups, and we sample the model as usual to infer robust model parameters and inlier / outlier flags:

$$
\mathcal{logL} = \sum_{i}^{i=N} log \left[ \frac{(1 - B_{i})}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_{in}^{2}}} exp \left( - \frac{(x_{i} - \mu_{in})^{2}}{2\sigma_{in}^{2}} \right) \right] + \sum_{i}^{i=N} log \left[ \frac{B_{i}}{\sqrt{2 \pi (\sigma_{in}^{2} + \sigma_{out}^{2})}} exp \left( - \frac{(x_{i}- \mu_{out})^{2}}{2(\sigma_{in}^{2} + \sigma_{out}^{2})} \right) \right]
$$

where:  
+ $B_{i}$ is Bernoulli-distibuted $B_{i} \in \{0_{(inlier)},1_{(outlier)}\}$
+ $\mu_{in} = \beta^{T} \vec{x}_{i}$ as before for inliers, where $\beta$ = $\{1, \beta_{j \in X_{j}}\}$  <--- linear coefs in 
$X_{j}$, in this case `1 + x`
+ $\sigma_{in}$ = noise term <--- in this case we set this to an _unpooled_ $\sigma_{i}$: the measured error `sigma_y` for each datapoint
+ $\mu_{out}$ <--- is a random _pooled_ variable for outliers
+ $\sigma_{out}$ = additional noise term <--- is a random _unpooled_ variable for outliers

+++

This notebook uses {func}`~pymc3.model.Potential` class combined with `logp` to create a likelihood and build this model where a feature is not observed, here the Bernoulli switching variable.

Usage of `Potential` is not discussed. Other resources are available that are worth referring to for details
on `Potential` usage:

+ [Junpenglao's presentation on likelihoods](https://github.com/junpenglao/All-that-likelihood-with-PyMC3) at PyData Berlin July 2018
+ worked examples on [Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/t/pm-potential-much-needed-explanation-for-newbie/2341) and [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/252607/10625). 
+ and the pymc3 port of CamDP's Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers, Chapter 5 Loss Functions, [Example: Optimizing for the Showcase on The Price is Right](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter5_LossFunctions/Ch5_LossFunctions_PyMC3.ipynb)

    # state input data as Theano shared vars
    tsv_x = pm.Data("tsv_x", dfhoggs["x"], dims="datapoint_id")

### 5.2 Fit Model

+++

#### 5.2.1 Sample Posterior

+++

Note that `pm.sample` conveniently and automatically creates the compound sampling process to:
1. sample a Bernoulli variable (the class `is_outlier`) using a discrete sampler
2. sample the continuous variables using a continuous sampler

Further note:
+ This also means we can't initialise using ADVI, so will init using `jitter+adapt_diag`
+ In order to pass `kwargs` to a particular stepper, wrap them in a dict addressed to the lowercased [name of the stepper](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/blob/master/pymc3/sampling.py) e.g. `nuts={'target_accept': 0.85}`

```{code-cell} ipython3
with mdl_hogg:
    trc_hogg = pm.sample(
        tune=10000,
        draws=500,
        chains=4,
        cores=4,
        init="jitter+adapt_diag",
        nuts={"target_accept": 0.99},
        return_inferencedata=True,
    )
```

#### 5.2.2 View Diagnostics

+++

We will illustrate this model fit and compare to the datapoints in the final comparison plot

```{code-cell} ipython3
rvs = ["beta", "y_est_out", "sigma_y_out", "frac_outliers"]
_ = az.plot_trace(trc_hogg, var_names=rvs, compact=False);
```

**Observe:**

+ At the default `target_accept = 0.8` there are lots of divergences, indicating this is not a particularly stable model
+ However, at `target_accept = 0.9` (and increasing `tune` from 5000 to 10000), the traces exhibit fewer divergences and appear slightly better behaved.
+ The traces for the inlier model `beta` parameters, and for outlier model parameter `y_est_out` (the mean) look reasonably converged
+ The traces for outlier model param `y_sigma_out` (the additional pooled variance) occasionally go a bit wild
+ It's interesting that `frac_outliers` is so dispersed: that's quite a flat distribution: suggests that there are a few datapoints where their inlier/outlier status is subjective
+ Indeed as Thomas noted in his v2.0 Notebook, because we're explicitly modeling the latent label (inlier/outlier) as binary choice the sampler could have a problem - rewriting this model into a marginal mixture model would be better.

Plot posterior joint distribution

(This is a particularly useful diagnostic in this case where we see a lot of divergences in the traces: maybe the model specification leads to weird behaviours)

```{code-cell} ipython3
marginal_kwargs["color"] = "C2"
marginal_kwargs["rug"] = True
x = az.plot_pair(
    data=trc_hogg,
    var_names="beta",
    kind=["kde", "scatter"],
    divergences=True,
    marginals=True,
    marginal_kwargs=marginal_kwargs,
    scatter_kwargs={"color": "C2"},
)
ax[0, 0].get_figure().suptitle("Posterior joint distribution (mdl_hogg)");
```

)

);
```

**Observe:**

+ The `hogg_inlier` and `studentt` models converge to similar ranges for 
`b0_intercept` and `b1_slope`, indicating that the (unshown) `hogg_outlier` 
model might perform a similar job to the fat tails of the `studentt` model: 
allowing greater log probability away from the main linear distribution in the datapoints
+ As expected, (since it's a Normal) the `hogg_inlier` posterior has thinner 
 tails and more probability mass concentrated about the central values
+ The `hogg_inlier` model also appears to have moved farther away from both the 
`ols` and `studentt` models on the `b0_intercept`, suggesting that the outliers 
really distort that particular dimension

At each step of the traces, each datapoint may be either an inlier or outlier. We hope that the datapoints spend an unequal time being one state or the other, so let's take a look at the simple count of states for each of the 20 datapoints.

```{code-cell} ipython3
dfm_outlier_results = trc_hogg.posterior.is_outlier.to_dataframe().reset_index()

with plt.rc_context({"figure.constrained_layout.use": False}):
    gd = sns.catplot(
        y="datapoint_id",
        x="is_outlier",
        data=dfm_outlier_results,
        kind="point",
        join=False,
        height=6,
        aspect=2,
    )
_ = gd.fig.axes[0].set(xlim=(-0.05, 1.05), xticks=np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1))
_ = gd.fig.axes[0].axvline(x=0, color="b", linestyle=":")
_ = gd.fig.axes[0].axvline(x=1, color="r", linestyle=":")
_ = gd.fig.axes[0].yaxis.grid(True, linestyle="-", which="major", color="w", alpha=0.4)
_ = gd.fig.suptitle(
    ("For each datapoint, distribution of outlier classification " + "over the trace"),
    y=1.04,
    fontsize=16,
)
```

**Observe**:

+ The plot above shows the proportion of samples in the traces in which each datapoint is marked as an outlier, expressed as a percentage.
+ 3 points [p2, p3, p4] spend >=95% of their time as outliers
+ Note the mean posterior value of `frac_outliers ~ 0.27`, corresponding to approx 5 or 6 of the 20 datapoints: we might investigate datapoints `[p1, p12, p16]` to see if they lean towards being outliers

The 95% cutoff we choose is subjective and arbitrary, but I prefer it for now, so let's declare these 3 to be outliers and see how it looks compared to Jake Vanderplas' outliers, which were declared in a slightly different way as points with means above 0.68.

+++

#### 5.3.2 Declare outliers

**Note:**
+ I will declare outliers to be datapoints that have value == 1 at the 5-percentile cutoff, i.e. in the percentiles from 5 up to 100, their values are 1. 
+ Try for yourself altering cutoff to larger values, which leads to an objective ranking of outlier-hood.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cutoff = 0.05
dfhoggs["classed_as_outlier"] = (
    trc_hogg.posterior["is_outlier"].quantile(cutoff, dim=("chain", "draw")) == 1
)
dfhoggs["classed_as_outlier"].value_counts()
```

Also add flag for points to be investigated. Will use this to annotate final plot

```{code-cell} ipython3
dfhoggs["annotate_for_investigation"] = (
    trc_hogg.posterior["is_outlier"].quantile(0.75, dim=("chain", "draw")) == 1
)
dfhoggs["annotate_for_investigation"].value_counts()
```

        "Standardized datapoints in Hogg 2010 dataset, showing "
        "posterior predictive fit for 3 models:\nOLS, StudentT and Hogg "
        '"Signal vs Noise" (inlier vs outlier, custom likelihood)'
    ),
    y=1.04,
    fontsize=14,
);
```

**Observe**:

The posterior preditive fit for:
+ the **OLS model** is shown in **Green** and as expected, it doesn't appear to fit the majority of our datapoints very well, skewed by outliers
+ the **Student-T model** is shown in **Orange** and does appear to fit the 'main axis' of datapoints quite well, ignoring outliers
+ the **Hogg Signal vs Noise model** is shown in two parts:
    + **Blue** for inliers fits the 'main axis' of datapoints well, ignoring outliers
    + **Red** for outliers has a very large variance and has assigned 'outlier' points with more log likelihood than the Blue inlier model 
    
    
We see that the **Hogg Signal vs Noise model** also yields specific estimates of _which_ datapoints are outliers:
+ 17 'inlier' datapoints, in **Blue** and
+ 3 'outlier' datapoints shown in **Red**.
+ From a simple visual inspection, the classification seems fair, and agrees with Jake Vanderplas' findings.
+ I've annotated these Red and the most outlying inliers to aid visual investigation
    
    
Overall:
+ the **Hogg Signal vs Noise model** behaves as promised, yielding a robust regression estimate and explicit labelling of inliers / outliers, but
+ the **Hogg Signal vs Noise model** is quite complex, and whilst the regression seems robust, the traceplot shoes many divergences, and the model is potentially unstable
+ if you simply want a robust regression without inlier / outlier labelling, the **Student-T model** may be a good compromise, offering a simple model, quick sampling, and a very similar estimate.
