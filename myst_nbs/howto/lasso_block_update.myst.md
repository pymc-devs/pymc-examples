```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

%matplotlib inline
import arviz as az
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pymc as pm

print(f"Running on PyMC v{pm.__version__}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
RANDOM_SEED = 8927
rng = np.random.default_rng(RANDOM_SEED)
az.style.use("arviz-darkgrid")
```

Sometimes, it is very useful to update a set of parameters together. For example, variables that are highly correlated are often good to update together. In PyMC block updating is simple. This will be demonstrated using the parameter `step` of {class}`pymc.sample`.

Here we have a [LASSO regression model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)#Bayesian_interpretation) where the two coefficients are strongly correlated. Normally, we would define the coefficient parameters as a single random variable, but here we define them separately to show how to do block updates.

First we generate some fake data.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = rng.standard_normal(size=(3, 30))
x1 = x[0] + 4
x2 = x[1] + 4
noise = x[2]
y_obs = x1 * 0.2 + x2 * 0.3 + noise
```

Then define the random variables.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

lam = 3000

with pm.Model() as model:
    sigma = pm.Exponential("sigma", 1)
    tau = pm.Uniform("tau", 0, 1)
    b = lam * tau
    beta1 = pm.Laplace("beta1", 0, b)
    beta2 = pm.Laplace("beta2", 0, b)

    mu = x1 * beta1 + x2 * beta2

    y = pm.Normal("y", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y_obs)
```

For most samplers, including {class}`pymc.Metropolis` and {class}`pymc.HamiltonianMC`, simply pass a list of variables to sample as a block. This works with both scalar and array parameters.

```{code-cell} ipython3
with model:
    step1 = pm.Metropolis([beta1, beta2])

    step2 = pm.Slice([sigma, tau])

    idata = pm.sample(draws=10000, step=[step1, step2])
```

We conclude by plotting the sampled marginals and the joint distribution of `beta1` and `beta2`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

az.plot_trace(idata);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
az.plot_pair(
    idata,
    var_names=["beta1", "beta2"],
    kind="hexbin",
    marginals=True,
    figsize=(10, 10),
    gridsize=50,
)
```
