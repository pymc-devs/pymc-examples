PyMC Examples
==============

Supporting examples and tutorials for PyMC, the Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning!

Check out the `getting started guide <https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/learn.html>`__,  or
interact with live examples using Binder! Each notebook in `PyMC examples gallery
<https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html>`__ has a binder badge.
For questions on PyMC, head on over to our `PyMC Discourse <https://discourse.pymc.io/>`__ forum.

Contributing
============

If you are interested in contributing to the example notebooks hosted here, please read the
`contributing guide <https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

Getting started
===============

If you already know about Bayesian statistics:
----------------------------------------------


-  `API quickstart guide <https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/howto/api_quickstart.html>`__
-  The `PyMC tutorial <https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/learn/core_notebooks/pymc_overview.html>`__
-  `PyMC examples <https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html>`__ and the `API reference <https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api.html>`__



Learn Bayesian statistics with a book together with PyMC:
----------------------------------------------------------

-  `Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers>`__ by Cameron Davidson-Pilon: Fantastic book with many applied code examples.
-  `Doing Bayesian Data Analysis <https://github.com/aloctavodia/Doing_bayesian_data_analysis>`__ by John Kruschke, as well as the `second edition <https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python>`__: Principled introduction to Bayesian data analysis.
-  `Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan <https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking>`__ by Richard McElreath: Comprehensive text on modeling choices and interpretations.
-  `Bayesian Cognitive Modeling <https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/BCM>`__ by Michael Lee and EJ Wagenmakers: Focused on using Bayesian statistics in cognitive modeling.
-  `Bayesian Analysis with Python <https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python-second-edition>`__ (second edition) by Osvaldo Martin: Great introductory book. (`code <https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP>`__ and errata).
